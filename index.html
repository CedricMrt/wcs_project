        <h2>About the Kingdom</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome visitor, to the Kingdom of Colchis,
            come and discover and why not settle in our magnificent region governed by King Aeetes and Queen Idyia, under the protection of our powerful army.
            but first a little history and information on this region. <br><br>
            COLCHIS, in ancient geography, a nearly triangular district of Asia Minor. at the eastern extremity of the Black Sea, bounded on the North by the Caucasus, which separated it from Asiatic Sarmatia, East by Iberia, South by the Montes Moschici, Armenia and part of Pontus, and Weast by the Euxine. <br> <br>
            
            The name of Colchis first appears in Aeschylus and Pindar. It was inhabited by a number of tribes whose settlements lay chiefly along the shore of the Black Sea. The chief of those were the Lazi, Moschi, Apsilae, Abasci, Sagadae, Suani and Coraxi. These tribes differed so completely in language and appearance from the surrounding nations, that the ancients originated various theories to account for the phenomenon. <br> <br>
            
            From Colchis is derived the name of the plant Colchicum.
